        <h2>Graduate</h2>
        <p>I am a graduate student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute majoring in Information Technology and Web Science with a concentration in Information Security
          and I have a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering. Engineers have the power to impact the world we live in today and I am glad to have the
          chance to be able to work towards a better future and leave my mark on history. My philosophy when it comes
          to engineering tasks is I either know how to do it or i'll learn how to do it. Outside of engineering
          I enjoy taking pictures, volleyball and exploring new places. Growing up in New York City I am lucky
          enough to be surrounded by a multitude of cultures and it's so much fun being able to go to different
          parts of the city and experience so many new restaurants. Please press the food list button below to
          see great restaurants to go to if you want some amazing restaurants all across the country!</p>

            <p>I am leading a team of five people to create a new way of recommending food to your friends. We
               are creating an app and website that will allow people to interact and receive recommendation from
               local people and friends instead of tourist who don't know the hidden gems. We are using C#.Net for the
               app and Node.js for the website with our database in AWS. </p>

            <p>I am leading a team of four to design a commercial LED system for hospitals that acts
              as a high bit rate transceiver and receiver for data transfer. We are working to incorporate
              this in connected health devices to patients to achieve less deaths from mishearing an alarm or
              not realizing how severe a patient's condition is. We have submitted a provisional patent through
              Rensselaer and press <a href="./img/LED.pdf">here</a> to see our paper that was submitted for the MANE Journal in the Congressional Library.</p>

            <h1>Bird be Gone</h1>
            <h2>Saving The Planet One Step At A Time</h2>
            <p>For a Hackathon project me and a team of three other people worked on a prototype of a low cost ultrasonic device that would use computer vision
               to determine if a bird was coming close to a wind turbine, play a noise in a range that only birds can hear which also annoys them into flying around
               the turbine. We are looking into methods to track how this would affect migration patterns and reasonable ways to represent this data. To view the code click

            <h2>Going Into Your Room Has Never Been so Cool</h2>
            <p>As a fun personal project, I wanted to always walk into my room in style. I created a computer vision program to recognize my face and play Hotel California
               for 15 seconds. This was achieved using openCV and Spotify's API. I am looking to expand this by improving my model to better detect other faces with my terrible
               webcam and creating a UI for people to incorporate in their own homes. To view the code click <a href="https://github.com/mattlevine68/Theme-Song-Generator">here</a>. </p>

          <h2>Don't get Robbed Anymore!</h2>
          <p>For our Microprocesor System class my partner and I created a home security system that worked through our STM32F7 Microprocesor. We connected a Webcam and PIR
             sensor and used the USB, I2C, DCMI, GPIO and UART buses to allow our device to work. This was done in C in the STM32 IDE and we worked on creating our own USB driver class
             to allow usage of our webcam. To view the code click <a href="https://github.com/mattlevine68/MPS-Final-Project">here</a>. </p>
